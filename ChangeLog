0.4:
Adjustments for portability: nested functions are a GCC extension and should not be used, include headers needed on other systems.
Use memcpy in some places instead of *x=y and x=*y to avoid alignment issues.
0.3:
Handle 'joins', 'join', 'nick' and 'quit' messages from the server (contributed by Jade)
Moved the AMF message writing functions into a separate source file.
Added irchack.c, a simple application that acts as an IRC server mirroring a tinychat channel using tc_client.
0.2:
Added support for non-ascii characters (sent as ISO-8859-1 to/from the server)
