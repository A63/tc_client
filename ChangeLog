Prompt for password if a username is given with -u/--user but no password (-p/--pass) is given.
Turn account names lowercase to comply with tinychat's quirks.
Handle networking being down at startup more graciously.
Added modbot.c, a bot that deals with playing videos.
0.14:
Use iconv to deal with tinychat's ISO-8859-1 instead of the wcs functions.

Added -u/--user and -p/--pass options to log into tinychat accounts.
0.13:
Check the validity of nicknames before switching.
Roll our own endianness conversion functions since the ones provided by libc are not standardized.
0.12:
Wrote a sender for the RTMP code and changed the AMF0 writer to use it, plus working directly with the rtmp struct instead of an intermediate amfmsg struct.
Added handling of moderators turning into regular users, or 'deop' (contributed by Jade)
Handle new nicknames being in use when using /nick, and thus failing (contributed by Jade)
0.11:
Rewrote the RTMP code to read from the socket instead of from a buffer, this will prevent messages from being dropped when they are larger than the buffer.

0.6:
Fixed a bug in the ID list that kept IDs from being removed correctly.
Show colors using ANSI escape codes.

Fixed a bug in irchack.c that sent the JOIN confirmation to the wrong file descriptor.
Avoid sending empty lines.
Handle messages related to getting kicked out/banned from a channel. (contributed by Jade)
0.4:
Adjustments for portability: nested functions are a GCC extension and should not be used, include headers needed on other systems.
Use memcpy in some places instead of *x=y and x=*y to avoid alignment issues.
0.3:
Handle 'joins', 'join', 'nick' and 'quit' messages from the server (contributed by Jade)
Moved the AMF message writing functions into a separate source file.
