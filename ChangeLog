Renamed streamids to chunkids to better match the specification.
Added a /close command for mods to close cam/mic streams.
Added /ban, /banlist and /forgive commands.

Handle "/userinfo $request", responding with the account name if logged in and otherwise "tc_client" (which is not a valid tinychat account name but the flash client will show it anyway)

Improved the way RTMP payloads are read from the stream.
modbot: when someone joins, send a /mbs (start video) command with the current position in the video, but only to that user.

irchack: keep listening for connections and accept the next after a session ends.
