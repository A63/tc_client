Some notes about tc_client in its current state (things that should be fixed):
*there is no real user interface, to send a message you just type it and it might get cut off by incoming messages, it'll be ugly. There is however the irchack program that lets you use an IRC client.
*PMs can be sent by /msg <nickname> <message> and replies appear similarly. Note however that PMs sent this way are currently sent to everyone in the channel, but the flash client ignores them.
*you can't log in with an account and thus not do mod stuff, I don't know how this works protocol-wise

Some things that will probably never change:
*tc_client can't view people's webcams or listen to mics
*tc_client can't stream/broadcast your webcam/mic
*tc_client probably won't ever play youtube videos (although you can see when one is launched and get the video ID because it is sent as a message and can then open it yourself)

Current commands sent by the TC servers that tc_client doesn't know how to handle:
notice
topic
joinsdone
avons (list of people currently on cam)
pros
oper
