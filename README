tc_client is a very primitive application, it doesn't implement a user interface on its own,
you could use it stand-alone but it will be ugly and if someone says something while you are typing a message your input-line will get cut off.
Better interfaces can be implemented as wrappers that launch tc_client with stdin and stdout as pipes.

Commands supported by tc_client:
/msg <nickname> <message> = send a PM, incoming PMs look similar
/color <on/off>           = enable/disable showing colors with ANSI escapes
/color <0-15>             = set the color of your outgoing messages
/colors                   = list the available colors
/nick <newnick>           = change nickname

Some things that will probably never change:
*tc_client can't view people's webcams or listen to mics
*tc_client can't stream/broadcast your webcam/mic
*tc_client itself won't play youtube videos, but applications that rely on tc_client can interpret the /mbs, /mbsk and /mbc commands

Current commands sent by the TC servers that tc_client doesn't know how to handle:
notice
joinsdone
avons (list of people currently on cam)
pros

Included applications that rely on tc_client (type 'make utils' to build):
*irchack = a minimal IRC server that translates between IRC and tc_client's commands
*modbot  = a bot that handles youtube video requests with a queue and an approval system to keep inappropriate videos from being played. Supports the following commands: !help, !request, !queue (show queue status), for mods only: !playnext (try playing next in queue without marking it yet), !approve, !badvid (Note: modbot depends on youtube-dl to find out the length of videos)
