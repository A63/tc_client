    <tr><td>!approve entire queue</td><td>approve all videos in queue (for playlists)</td></tr>

    <tr><td>!badvid &lt;link/searchterm&gt;</td><td>mark the specified video as bad, preventing it from ever being queued again</td></tr>
    <tr><td>!skip &lt;number&gt;</td><td>skip a given number of videos from the queue without approving them nor marking them as bad, if no number is given it defaults to 1</td></tr>
